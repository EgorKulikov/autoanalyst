This is initial work by Jan Kuipers to generate graphics plots
about contest statistics.

The python program 'languages.py' generates a GNUplot program
as output that draws a bar chart of languages used. Run as:

$ ./languages.py | gnuplot

See sample languages.eps output file.

It currently queries a DOMjudge SQL database.
