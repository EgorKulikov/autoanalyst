ICPC-live autoanalyst image
===========================

This image contains a ready-to-use Debian GNU/Linux operating system
with the ICPC-live autoanalyst software toolset installed on it.


Booting the image
-----------------

The image contains a default minimal Debian Wheezy installation with
the ICPC-live autoanalyst software from

  https://github.com/icpc-live/autoanalyst

This is a raw image that can be written to a harddisk, USB stick or
similar, but it can also be used as virtual machine image.

A script 'icpclive' is included to perform some basic tasks, such as
changing passwords from the defaults. Run it without arguments on the
console for more information.


Accessing the web interface
---------------------------

The web interface can be found under http://<hostname>/icpc/
See also http://<hostname>/ for a link to there and some other basic
information. Here <hostname> is the DNS name of the system.


Generating the image from sources
---------------------------------

This image can be generated semi-automatically from sources. First
obtain a copy of the ICPC-live autoanalyst Git repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/icpc-live/autoanalyst.git

Then switch to the 'autoanalyst/live-image' subdirectory and run
'make' to generate 'extra-files.tgz'.

Next, build a Debian Wheezy image. Download a Debian netinst CD for
Wheezy/i386 from http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/. Make the file
'preseed.cfg' available on a URL that can be accessed in the next
stage.

Create a file (or use a real block device) of at least 4GB to put the
image on. Now boot the netinst CD in a VM like qemu/kvm:

$ kvm -boot d -cdrom <debian-netinst.iso> -hda <icpc-live-target.img>

hit ESCAPE on the Debian installer boot screen and specify the
following kernel boot options:

  auto url=<webhost>/<path>/preseed.cfg

where the preseed.cfg file is made available at that url. Now a
complete Debian system should automatically be installed onto the
specified image.

After rebooting the image, optionally copy SSH keys for easier access:

$ ssh-copy-id root@<dhcp_hostname>

Note that the root password is set to 'icpclive'.

Then run the icpc-live specific install script:

$ ./install.sh <dhcp_hostname>

This will copy and extract the generated file 'extra-files.tgz' onto
the image and run 'install.sh' there. When this is finished, you
should have a freshly generated ICPC-live autoanalyst image.
